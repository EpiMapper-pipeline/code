INFO: All the steps as described below must be run separately.

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES/REQUIREMENTS:
The requirements can be found in requirements.txt.

INSTALLING THE COMMAND LINE APPLICATION:
Go the the EpiMapper directory and type:
python setup.py install


NAMING INFO:

* All input FASTQ files must follow a naming protocol, this is to ensure smooth transitions between the pipeline´s functions. The naming protocol is as follows:

	[SAMPEL-NAME]_rep[REPLICATION-NUMBER]_[R1/R2]_[(TECHNICAL-REPLICATE)].fastq

	The sample name section must not contain underscore “_” or dot “.” in the name.

	If there are no technical replicates, skip the number.
	
	Examples:
	
		H4K3me3_rep1_R2.fastq

		ZNF143-Control-48h_rep1_R1.fastq

		IgG_rep1_R2_001.fastq

		Control-sample_rep2_R2.fastq

USAGE: 

> epimapper -h
usage: epimapper <task> [<args>]

Tasks available for usage:

	fastqc 			Performs quality control on raw reads fastq files
				from high-throughput sequencing.

	bowtie2_alignment 	Mapping reads to a reference genome with Bowtie2
 				alignment of fastq sequencing reads files from
 				high-throughput sequencing, and visualizing results.

	remove_duplicates 	Remove duplicated reads mapped to the same place
				in of a reference genome during alignment,
				and visualizing results.

	fragment_length		Evaluation of mapped fragment length distribution
				of input SAM files exported from high-throughput 
				sequencing alignment, and visualizing results.

	spike_in_calibration 	Removes experimental bias by normalizing fragment 
				counts based on sequencing depth to a spike-in genome
				and visualizing results.

	peak_calling 		Finds enriched regions/calls for peaks from chromatin
				profiling data with SEACR or MACS2, then visualizing results.

	heatmap 		Visualizes the enrichment of target protein in predefined
				genomic regions and peaks by creating heatmaps.

	differential_analysis 	Performs differential analysis on enriched regions/peaks
				before annotating the statistically significant changes 
				to specific genomic regions and visualize the results.
